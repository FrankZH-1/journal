      1. using the proxy tool ```whistle``` 
      2. config the tool correctly including set the protocal certificate
      3. set the reverse proxy, to direct the access to the corp website from "crm-admin-dev.u1.netease.com" to the local host server "127.0.0.1:3000"
      4. now the redirect after the login behaviour to the online server will be led to the local server instead to suit your development procedure.

When you type a domain name into your web browser, your computer first checks the hosts file to see if there is a corresponding IP address specified. If there is, it uses that IP address to connect to the desired server directly, bypassing DNS resolution.
         2. but the host file cannot change the port number, it will only use the default with 80.
